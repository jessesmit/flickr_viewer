Basic PHP web application for searching and retrieving public Flickr photos based on tags.

First ever use of PHP so not likely a good reference for PHP best practice.. Happy to take criticism with regards to how to do it better though!

Not implemented (potential, though unlikely, TODOs):
- Pagination
- Proper view for larger images
- Flickr authentication for private photos
- Better results layout. Wrapped images is simple and responsive but far from elegant
- General look and feel improvements
- Any kind of automated testing

Requires Composer and 

```
composer install
```

to resolve dependencies.
